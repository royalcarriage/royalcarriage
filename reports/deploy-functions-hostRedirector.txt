Failed to set the IAM Policy on the function projects/royalcarriagelimoseo/locations/us-central1/functions/hostRedirector

Functions deploy had errors with the following functions:
	hostRedirector(us-central1)

Unable to set the invoker for the IAM policy on the following functions:
	hostRedirector(us-central1)

Some common causes of this:

- You may not have the roles/functions.admin IAM role. Note that roles/functions.developer does not allow you to change IAM policies.

- An organization policy that restricts Network Access on your project.

One or more functions were being implicitly made publicly available on function create.
Functions are not implicitly made public on updates. To try to make these functions public on next deploy, configure these functions with invoker set to "public"
